<!--markdownlint-disable MD013 MD029 MD036 MD024 MD033 MD040 MD042 MD001 MD051 MD025-->

### 1.Define OOPS?

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming methodology which offers a new model where data and processes are integrated.
 e.g: C++, C#, Java

### 2.What is Encapsulation ?

***Short Answer:*** Binds code and data

***Long Answer:*** Encapsulation is the mechanism that binds together the code and data it manipulates into a single unit and keeps them safe from external interference and misuse.

In C++ this is supported by a construct called class.

### 3.What is Data Abstraction ?

***Short Answer:*** Hide background details

***Long Answer:*** The technique of creating a new data type that are well suited to an application to be programmed is known as data abstraction.

e.g: Stack – We can use push & pop without bothering how the push and pop operations performed.

The class is a construct in C++ for creating user-defined data types called Abstract Data Types (ADT’s)

### 4.What is Polymorphism ?

***Short Answer:*** Polymorphism means the ability to assume several forms.

***Long Answer:*** Polymorphism refers to the ability of an entity to refer to objects of various classes at runtime.

### 5.What is Inheritance ?

***Short Answer:*** Extension & reuse of existing code

***Long Answer:*** Inheritance allows the extension & reuse of existing code (class) without having to rewrite the code from scratch. Inheritance involves the creation of a new class (derived class) from the existing ones (base classes)

The new derived class inherits the members of the base class and also adds its own.

e.g: Child inherits features from their parents refine some of them and add a few of their own.

### 6.What is Object-Based Language ?

Languages that do not support OOPS featurs like inheritance and polymorphism but only supports objects are called object-based language.
 e.g: Visual Basic

### 7.Why we use Interface ?

Interfaces provides the flexibility to change the Implemenatation with out breaking the existing clients. Interfaces are used in COM, EJB e.t.c
