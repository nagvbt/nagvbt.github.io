# ðŸ’» Introduction to C++

C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language developed by **Bjarne Stroustrup** in the
early 1980s. It was created as an extension of the C programming language, incorporating support
for **object-oriented programming** and other modern programming concepts.

## ðŸš€ Key Features of C++

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Supports classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Low-Level Memory Manipulation:** Provides direct control over system memory using pointers and
manual memory management.
- **Standard Template Library (STL):** Offers a rich collection of pre-built classes and functions
for data structures and algorithms.
- **High Performance:** Widely used in applications where speed and resource efficiency are critical.
- **Cross-Platform:** C++ code can be compiled and run on multiple operating systems.

## ðŸ§  Why Learn C++?

C++ is widely used in various domains, including:

- System/software development (e.g., operating systems, compilers)
- Game development
- Real-time simulations
- Embedded systems
- High-frequency trading systems

## ðŸŒŸ Modern C++

Recent updates (C++11, C++14, C++17, and C++20) have introduced modern programming features such as:

- Lambda expressions
- Smart pointers
- Auto keyword
- Range-based for loops
- Concurrency support

These features make C++ more expressive, safer, and efficient.
