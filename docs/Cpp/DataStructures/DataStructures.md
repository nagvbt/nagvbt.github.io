### 1.What is a Data Structures ?

Data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.

### 2.What are the types of Data Structures ?

1.Fixed-Size Data structures: such as one-dimensional arrays, two-dimensional arrays and structs.

2.Dynamic data structures: grow and shrink during execution.

### 3.What are the types of Dynamic Data Structures ?

Linear data structures and Nonlinear data structures

### 4.Define Linear data structures ?

The data items are arranged in a sequential structure. Example

 1. Linked lists
 2. Stacks
 3. Queues

### 5.What is a Linked  List ?

Linked lists are collections of data items "lined up in a row" insertions and removals are made anywhere in a linked list.

### 6.What is a Stack ?

Stacks are important in compilers and operating systems: Insertions and removals are made only at one end of a stackits top.

### 7.What is a Queue ?

Queues represent waiting lines; insertions are made at the back (also referred to as the tail) of a queue and removals are made from the front (also referred to as the head) of a queue.

### 8.Define Nonlinear data structures ?

The data items are not arranged in a sequential structure. Example: Binary Tree

### 9.What is a Binary Tree ?

Binary trees facilitate high-speed searching and sorting of data, efficient elimination of duplicate data items, representation of file system directories and compilation of expressions into machine language.
