# üñ•Ô∏è Introduction to C Programming

C is a **procedural programming language** developed in the early 1970s by **Dennis Ritchie** at Bell
Labs. It was originally created to develop the UNIX operating system and has since become one of the
most influential programming languages in computer science history.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features of C

- **Low-Level Access to Memory:** C supports pointers and direct memory manipulation, making it ideal
 for system-level programming.
- **Simple and Efficient:** C provides a minimal set of keywords and a clear structure, which helps
 in writing efficient programs.
- **Portable Code:** C programs can run on different platforms with little or no modification.
- **Rich Standard Library:** Offers a variety of built-in functions for input/output, memory
operations, and more.
- **Compiled Language:** C code is compiled to machine code, which enables faster execution.

## üõ†Ô∏è Where is C Used?

C is widely used in:

- Operating system development (e.g., UNIX, Linux, Windows)
- Embedded systems and firmware
- Compilers and interpreters
- Database engines
- Game development (especially game engines)

## üìå Why Learn C?

- It builds a strong foundation in computer science concepts.
- It teaches how hardware interacts with software.
- It‚Äôs essential for understanding how high-level languages work internally.

## üß† Fun Fact

Languages like **C++**, **Java**, **Python**, and **Go** were either directly influenced by C or
implemented in C at some level.

C continues to be a foundational language in both education and industry. Mastering C opens the door
to understanding how software truly works under the hood.
