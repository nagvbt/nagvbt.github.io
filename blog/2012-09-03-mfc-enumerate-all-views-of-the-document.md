To Enumerate all views of the document the CDocument class provides GetFirstViewPosition and GetNextView member functions to enumerate all views associated with the document. We call viewâ€™s OnUpdate function to communicate with them.

```c
void EnumerateViews()
{
   //get the position of the first view in the list
   //of views associated with the document.
   POSITION pos = GetFirstViewPosition();

   //terate through all of the document's views.
   while (pos != NULL)
   {
      CView\* pView = GetNextView(pos);

      //update view
      pView-&gt;OnUpdate(pSender, lHint, pHint);
   }
}
```
