<!--markdownlint-disable MD013 MD029 MD036 MD024 MD033 MD040 MD042 MD001 MD051 MD025 MD052 MD045-->
Today I had completed a book [When Breath Becomes Air](https://amzn.to/3yt4tjr) by Paul Kalanithi a Neurosurgeon. Book covers What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when life is catastrophically interrupted? What does it mean to have a child as your own life fades away?
