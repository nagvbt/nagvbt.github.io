    CRect r;
    //GetClientRect gets the width & height of the client area of the Dialog
    GetClientRect(&r);
    CBrush br(RGB(0,255,0));
    pDC->SelectObject(br);
    pDC->FillRect(r,&br);
    
    //Make sure to return TRUE;
     //return CDialogEx::OnEraseBkgnd(pDC);
    return TRUE;

    HBRUSH CTNV\_MFCDialogDemoDlg::OnCtlColor(CDC\* pDC, CWnd\* pWnd, UINT nCtlColor)
    {
    //HBRUSH hbr = CDialogEx::OnCtlColor(pDC, pWnd, nCtlColor);
     //return hbr;
    

//Make sure to return the Brush color should be same as Dialog Background color CBrush br(RGB(0,255,0)); return (HBRUSH)br; }
