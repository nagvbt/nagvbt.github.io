Tired to install and manage different individual Social IMs like Yahoo!™, Windows Live Messenger® (MSN), GoogleTalk etc. Come on and get freedom to use one IM that is Nimbuzz

we can use Nimbuzz everywhere, on your mobile phone, desktopcomputer, or even the Internet browser.

we can even import friends from popular instant messaging and social networks, such Facebook©, Yahoo!™, Windows Live Messenger® (MSN), GoogleTalk and SIP/VoIP accounts. And can chat with all of your friends.

Personally I had Installed Nimbuzz on my Laptop and on my Iphone to save the memory and to increase the performance of my hardware.
