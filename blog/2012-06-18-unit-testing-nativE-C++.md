Unit Testing Native C++ Applications with out “/clr” flag or fall back to 3rd party frameworks

Visual Studio 11 provides the ability to do Unit Testing Native C++ Applications with a new C++ unit testing framework shipping with VS 11.

So the C++ developers no longer need to use the “/clr” flag or fall back to 3rd party frameworks.
