# Angular Vs React which one you use

Technology evaluation is some times challenging when we have best technologies available. Let us see who wins Angular or React.  
Features  

### Framework / Ecosystem:

**Angular 4**

Angular 4 is an MVC Framework itself.

  

**React**

React is only a view library one needs to choose the different libraries to make the Best Ecosystem. Refer my post for choosing the better parts to build a React Echosystem

_**Summary:** It takes time to build Ecosystem in React. Once built developers need not worry about the Ecosystem._  

### Technical Skills:

**Angular 4**

Angular 4 requires Typescript which is similar to C# / Java

Need to know about the angular directives/concepts

  

**React**

React requires JSX syntax which is similar to HTML and ES6 Javascript

React requires less time to master once the ecosystem build

_**Summary**: It depends on your current development team skills if they are familiar with Javascript go for React if the team is familiar with C#/Java go for Angular_  

### Tooling:

Both Angular 4 and React have great CLIs which work with webpack.  
  

### PWA:

**Angular 4**

Ionic 3 is a great framework to develop PWA which comes out of the box UI components. 

**React**

We don't have frameworks readily available.

  

_**Summary**: Ionic 3 is best for PWA development_

### Story Book:

**Angular 4**

Currently there is no such kind of  Tool

  

**React**

[Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) is a React development environment where we can develop UI components independently from the main application. One can browse a UI component library, view the different states of each component and interactively develop and verify components.

  

### Conclusion:

Best way to conclude between Angular 4 and React is to develop an PoCs with the cross cutting key features of the project like Translation, Theming, Accessibility, Form factors. I am slightly biased on the Angular 4 first latter having hands on React it own my heart. But if you have a team already working with AngularJS and has experience with Java/C#/C++ sticking with Angular 4 makes more weightage.
