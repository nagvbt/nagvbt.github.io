# All About Design Patterns

## Definition: 

Design Patterns represent solutions to problems that arise when developing software within a particular context.
Patterns help you learn from other's successes, instead of your own failures. Mark Johnson (cited by Bruce Eckel)

## Types of DesignÂ Patterns 

There are three types of design patterns

1. Creational Patterns: Creational Patterns deals with initializing and configuring classes and objects
2. Structural Patterns: Structural Patterns deals with decoupling the interface and implementation of classes and objects
3. Behavioral Patterns: Behavioral Patterns deals with dynamic interactions among societies of classes and objects

These three design patters are divided in to 22 different kinds of patterns as shown below.
