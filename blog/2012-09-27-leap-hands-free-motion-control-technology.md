<!--markdownlint-disable MD013 MD029 MD036 MD024 MD033 MD040 MD042 MD001 MD051 MD025 MD052-->
New way of interaction with the computers say good bye to Keyboard, Mouse even touch screen :)  ?

Yes it can be possible !

A San Francisco Company Leap Motion (`www.leapmotion.com`) developed Hands-free motion control Technology.

The website says:

" Leap represents an entirely new way to interact with your computers. It’s more accurate than a mouse, as reliable as a keyboard and more sensitive than a touchscreen.  For the first time, you can control a computer in three dimensions with your natural hand and finger movements.
This isn’t a game system that roughly maps your hand movements.  The Leap technology is 200 times more accurate than anything else on the market — at any price point. Just about the size of a flash drive, the Leap can distinguish your individual fingers and track your movements down to a 1/100th of a millimeter.
This is like day one of the mouse.  Except, no one needs an instruction manual for their hands. "
