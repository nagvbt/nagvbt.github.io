## Review

This books gives details about Elon Musk from his childhood to the latest development i.e
starting up new AI company based on AI Safety X.ai by pooling out best AI experts.

The first principle approach and his vision to establish colonies in Mars was well explained.

Many of his personals like about his father and children and legal battles are in this book.

Best books to get inspired from Elon Musk. Good Read for Entrepreneurs.
