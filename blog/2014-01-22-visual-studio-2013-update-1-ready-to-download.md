<!--markdownlint-disable MD013 MD029 MD036 MD024 MD033 MD040 MD042 MD001 MD051 MD025 MD052-->

In a [blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/somasegar/archive/2014/01/20/visual-studio-2013-update-1.aspx) post, S. Somasegar, Corporate Vice President of Microsoft Developer Division clearly mentioned that: “This is a targeted update, addressing some key areas of customer feedback since the Visual Studio 2013 release. For example, we heard your feedback about running Visual Studio in environments without IE10+, and have made several improvements to this experience in Update 1.” **New features for developers include:**

- IntelliTrace Viewer users should note that it's been updated to support Internet Explorer 9.
- A new version of Microsoft ASP.NET Web Frameworks and Tools (version 5.0.11213.0). It adds editing support for ASP.NET MVC 5.1 on top of all existing functionality from the Web Framework and Tools 5.0 release.
- A new version of Nuget, 2.7.2. It fixes a bug which caused certain packages to fail when running package restore, update or uninstall.
- Web tool, SignalR 2.0.1, which includes new item templates.
