# My Books
<!--markdownlint-disable MD013 MD029 MD036 MD024 MD033 MD040 MD042 MD001 MD051 MD025 MD052-->
I am bibliophile or bookworm and loves reading and/or collects books through purchase in online and offline books stores from various places.
So I got any thought to know how many books I had and how many books I had completed reading, So I had used the google sheets (online Excel) to list books with following columns

| SNo | Title               | Author        | Edition | Pages | Pages Read | Shelves | Date Read | Price | Current Price | Genre       | Sub-Genre        | Type      |
| --- | ------------------- | ------------- | ------- | ----- | ---------- | ------- | --------- | ----- | ------------- | ----------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| 1   | Think and Grow Rich | Napolian Hill | 1       | 254   | 254        | Read    | Dec-2000  | 50    | 249           | Non Fiction | Self Improvement | Paperback |

Most of the columns are self explanatory other are explained below:
